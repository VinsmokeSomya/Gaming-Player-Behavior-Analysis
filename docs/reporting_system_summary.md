# Automated Reporting System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The automated reporting system for player retention analytics has been successfully implemented as part of task 9. This system provides comprehensive daily reporting capabilities with automated alerting for unusual retention patterns.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core Reporting Service (`src/services/reporting.py`)

#### MetricsCalculator
- **Purpose**: Calculates key retention metrics
- **Metrics Supported**:
  - Daily Active Users (DAU)
  - Weekly Active Users (WAU) 
  - Monthly Active Users (MAU)
  - Churn Rate (7-day lookback)
  - Day 1, 7, and 30 retention rates
  - New player registrations
- **Features**: Error handling, database integration, weighted retention calculations

#### BaselineManager
- **Purpose**: Manages historical baselines for metrics comparison
- **Features**:
  - 30-day rolling baseline calculations
  - Automatic metrics storage for future baselines
  - Significance detection (10% threshold)
  - Threshold breach detection (20% for retention metrics, 25% for churn)

#### AlertManager
- **Purpose**: Generates and manages automated alerts
- **Alert Severities**: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- **Features**:
  - Automatic severity determination based on deviation percentage
  - Custom alert rules (high churn rate, low DAU)
  - Database storage with unique alert IDs
  - Email notification simulation (ready for SMTP integration)

#### ReportGenerator
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates complete daily report generation
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive daily retention reports
  - Executive summary generation
  - Cohort analysis integration
  - JSON report storage for historical access

### 2. Database Schema (`sql/init/05_reporting_tables.sql`)

#### Tables Created
- `daily_metrics_history`: Stores daily metrics for baseline calculations
- `retention_alerts`: Stores generated alerts with resolution tracking
- `daily_reports`: Stores complete daily reports in JSONB format
- `alert_notifications`: Tracks notification delivery status

#### Views and Triggers
- `recent_alerts_summary`: 7-day alert summary by severity
- `metrics_trends`: 90-day metrics trends with lag calculations
- Automatic `updated_at` timestamp triggers

### 3. Testing Suite (`tests/test_reporting.py`)

#### Test Coverage
- **25 comprehensive unit tests** covering all components
- **Test Categories**:
  - MetricsCalculator: 9 tests
  - BaselineManager: 5 tests  
  - AlertManager: 6 tests
  - ReportGenerator: 4 tests
  - Integration: 1 end-to-end test

#### Test Features
- Mock database interactions
- Edge case handling
- Error condition testing
- Integration testing with realistic data

### 4. Demo and Setup Scripts

#### Demo Script (`scripts/demo_reporting.py`)
- **Comprehensive demonstration** of all reporting features
- **Interactive examples** showing:
  - Key metrics calculation
  - Baseline comparison with significance detection
  - Alert generation with different severity levels
  - Complete daily report generation
  - Historical report access

#### Setup Script (`scripts/setup_reporting_tables.py`)
- **Automated database setup** for reporting tables
- **Sample data insertion** for immediate testing
- **Database schema validation**

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Daily Retention Summary Reports
- Automated generation of comprehensive daily reports
- Executive summary with key insights
- Cohort analysis integration
- JSON storage for historical access

### ✅ Key Metrics Calculation
- **DAU**: Daily active users with session-based calculation
- **WAU**: Weekly active users with week boundary handling
- **MAU**: Monthly active users with month boundary handling  
- **Churn Rate**: 7-day inactivity-based churn calculation
- **Retention Rates**: Weighted average retention across cohorts

### ✅ Historical Baseline Comparison
- 30-day rolling baseline calculations
- Automatic significance detection (10% threshold)
- Threshold breach detection with metric-specific rules
- Percentage change calculations with proper handling of zero baselines

### ✅ Automated Alert System
- **4-tier severity system**: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- **Automatic severity determination** based on deviation percentage
- **Custom alert rules** for business-critical scenarios
- **Database storage** with unique alert tracking
- **Notification system** ready for email/Slack integration

### ✅ Comprehensive Unit Tests
- **25 unit tests** with 100% pass rate
- **Mock-based testing** for database interactions
- **Edge case coverage** including error conditions
- **Integration testing** for end-to-end workflows

## Usage Examples

### Generate Daily Report
```python
from src.services.reporting import report_generator
from datetime import date

# Generate report for yesterday
report = report_generator.generate_daily_report(date.today() - timedelta(days=1))
print(report.summary)
```

### Calculate Individual Metrics
```python
from src.services.reporting import MetricsCalculator
from datetime import date

calculator = MetricsCalculator()
dau = calculator.calculate_dau(date.today())
churn_rate = calculator.calculate_churn_rate(date.today())
```

### Access Historical Reports
```python
from src.database import db_manager
from sqlalchemy import text

with db_manager.get_session() as session:
    result = session.execute(text("""
        SELECT report_date, report_data->>'summary' as summary
        FROM daily_reports 
        ORDER BY report_date DESC 
        LIMIT 5
    """))
    reports = result.fetchall()
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Database Optimization
- **Indexed queries** for efficient baseline calculations
- **JSONB storage** for flexible report data with GIN indexing
- **Connection pooling** with automatic retry logic
- **Optimized retention queries** with cohort-based calculations

### Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation** when database tables don't exist
- **Automatic fallbacks** for missing baseline data
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging and monitoring
- **Transaction safety** with automatic rollback on errors

## Next Steps for Production

### 1. Automated Scheduling
```bash
# Example cron job for daily report generation
0 6 * * * cd /path/to/project && python -c "from src.services.reporting import report_generator; report_generator.generate_daily_report()"
```

### 2. Email/Slack Integration
- Configure SMTP settings in `AlertManager._send_email_alerts()`
- Add Slack webhook integration for real-time notifications
- Implement recipient management and escalation rules

### 3. Dashboard Integration
- Create Dash/Plotly visualizations for report data
- Build interactive alert management interface
- Add real-time metrics monitoring

### 4. Data Retention Policies
- Implement automatic cleanup of old metrics data
- Archive historical reports to cold storage
- Set up alert resolution workflows
