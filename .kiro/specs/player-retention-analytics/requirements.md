# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive player retention analytics system for mobile games. The system will analyze player behavior data, predict churn risk, and provide actionable insights through visualizations to help game developers improve player engagement and retention rates.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game analyst, I want to analyze player retention data using SQL queries, so that I can understand player behavior patterns and identify trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes player data THEN it SHALL execute SQL queries to extract retention metrics
2. WHEN analyzing retention data THEN the system SHALL calculate daily, weekly, and monthly retention rates
3. WHEN querying player data THEN the system SHALL support filtering by date ranges, player segments, and game events
4. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL complete queries within 30 seconds for standard retention reports

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game analyst, I want a churn prediction model with high accuracy, so that I can proactively identify at-risk players.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the churn prediction model is trained THEN it SHALL achieve at least 80% accuracy on test data
2. WHEN predicting churn risk THEN the system SHALL provide probability scores for each player
3. WHEN generating predictions THEN the system SHALL update churn scores daily for active players
4. WHEN a player is identified as high-risk THEN the system SHALL flag them for retention campaigns
5. IF a player has been inactive for 7 days THEN the system SHALL automatically classify them as churned

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game analyst, I want interactive visualizations of player engagement patterns, so that I can quickly identify problem areas and opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying engagement data THEN the system SHALL show player activity heatmaps by time and day
2. WHEN visualizing retention THEN the system SHALL display cohort analysis charts
3. WHEN showing drop-off points THEN the system SHALL highlight specific game levels or features where players leave
4. WHEN generating charts THEN the system SHALL support filtering by player segments and time periods
5. WHEN displaying visualizations THEN the system SHALL render charts within 5 seconds

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to identify specific drop-off points in the game, so that I can optimize gameplay and reduce player churn.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing player progression THEN the system SHALL identify levels with abnormally high abandonment rates
2. WHEN detecting drop-off points THEN the system SHALL calculate the percentage of players who quit at each stage
3. WHEN showing progression data THEN the system SHALL display funnel visualizations for key game milestones
4. WHEN identifying problem areas THEN the system SHALL rank drop-off points by impact on overall retention

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want automated reporting of key retention metrics, so that I can track performance and make data-driven decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create daily retention summaries automatically
2. WHEN producing analytics THEN the system SHALL include key metrics like DAU, WAU, MAU, and churn rate
3. WHEN creating reports THEN the system SHALL compare current metrics to historical baselines
4. WHEN detecting significant changes THEN the system SHALL alert stakeholders of unusual retention patterns
5. IF retention drops below defined thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger automated notifications
